Hello All,

TLDR - run main.exe to run the program

Within the src folder, contains all the necesary files to run the code. From my testing, main.exe runs fine outside of the IDE, but in case it does not. This was coded using VSCode and *should* run in it.  

expanded_games.csv - 100,000 rows of games
dataset.csv - a smaller test csv
game.cpp - game class implmentation
game.h - game class header file
main.cpp - terminal based front end cpp
mergequicksort.cpp - contains functions for merge and quick sort
main.exe - RUN THIS TO RUN THE PROGRAM
